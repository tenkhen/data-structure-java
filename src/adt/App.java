// ABSTRACT DATA TYPE - Class should be trustworthy. All we need is just trust the class.
// No need to know how things are implemented in the class. It's like lawyer.
// It's a concept of minimizing the exposure of a class's contains.
// For example, in Counter class, we implemented all the functionalities of counting.
// So user doesn't need to know what is going on in Counter class. All they have to do
// is just instantiate the Counter class and call those methods.
